Data:

The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model is available in the data folder. This folder might contain subfolders for training, validation, and testing data depending on your project structure.

Code:

The core functionalities of the CNN model are implemented in the model.py script. This script likely includes functions for:

Loading and preprocessing the image data
Defining the CNN architecture
Training the model
Evaluating the model's performance
Running the Model (Optional):

A script for training and evaluating the model might be provided in a file named train.py or similar. Refer to the script's documentation (comments within the code) for specific instructions on running the training process.
